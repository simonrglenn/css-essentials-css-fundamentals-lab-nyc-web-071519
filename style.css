/*
Make our #details section horizontal: The details section could go nicely as a footer to the page, instead of a vertical list. Change its display value to block and make sure each of the <div>s is floating to the left.

As a finishing touch: Let's clean up the <div>s at the bottom of the page. All of them should have the same background color, centered text, and occupy 25% of the width of the bottom row (since we have 4 divs).
